Subject line: Follow up on Marketing strategy document

Hello Thandeka,

I hope this email finds you well.

This is a to follow up on the marketing strategy document for LearnWave's app ReadingRise.
You promised to deliver a 2-page overview of the strategy 3 days, however, I have still received it.

Thandeka, as the product manager of LearnWave, I need to include the marketing strategy document as part
of funding proposal to Mastercard Foundation in the next 3 days.

This is a hard deadline, however, our failure to submit a complete proposal will cost our company so much. Considering how urgent and important this strategic document is, I would appreciate it if you could do your possible best to submit the marketing strategy document at least a day before the proposed deadline for management review.

Counting on your usual cooperation.

Best regards,

Daniel
LeanWave
Product Manager
